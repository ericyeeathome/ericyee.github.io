    <h4>Montara Beach</h4>

    <p>
      After a hike up some rocks I had a beautiful view of the sky right after sunset as well as the crashing waves along the beach. This is probably one of my favorite spots in the bay area.

    <h4>Thailand</h4>

    <p>
      This sunset was taken while kayaking on mangroves while in Thailand. We were in two person kayaks and had to paddle out a mile before we got into open water. It was low tide so sometimes we got stuck in mud and had to carry the kayak out.

    <h4>Santa Cruz</h4>

    <p>
      This photo was taken after surfing in Pleasure Point, Santa Cruz. The waves were pretty small, but the session was pretty fun since I had not surfed for a while. It was fun just being in the water and enjoying the scenery.
